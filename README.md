# Portfolio
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on throughout my education and internship.

## R
I wrote this R code to predict the total sales for a new location for a small business.

The biggest problem that I faced during this project was the lack of data. Since the small business that I worked for was only opened 5 years ago, there were an insufficient number of observations to provide a truly accurate forecast.

If I had the chance to go back, I would not have done this project this way. I think a better alternative to my original method would be a simulation where I analyzed average ticket price and average daily tickets to project sales per day and extended that over one year with the same variables.

## Python
I wrote this Python code for a project to show where the probabilities converge for different bets in a Craps game.

I wanted to show a little bit of everything in this project. This project shows my familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks, HTML, imbedding images, matplotlib, probability, and basic Python coding.

## SAS
I wrote this SAS code to determine the statistical significance between graduation and retention rates of on- and off-campus students.

To me, this is my best project to data. I was given the opportunity to collaborate with my classmates on a major project for East Stroudsburg University. I was assigned as the leader of the statistical analysis group where I wrote the code above. We wanted to determine if housing had an impact on graduation and retention rates at our school. When we presented this project, I was extremely pleased with the reactions from the university's administration. I believe they were blown the results.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my projects. I hope this can add some context to the goals of my code.
